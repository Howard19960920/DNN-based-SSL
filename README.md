# DNN-based-SSL
DNN based Sound Source Localization

Sound Source Localization projects are mostly done by using TDOA, which is considered a physical method.
However in this project, we are going to make this work with DNN, without any previous calculations.

# First Goal
Out first goal is to make our trained models capable of recognizing the sound source from one of the nine points drawn on the table.
